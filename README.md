**Project Description: Topic Modeling and Engagement Analysis for Instagram Posts**

**Overview:**
This project aims to analyze Instagram post engagement through topic modeling of image labels generated by Google Vision. By employing Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), we extract underlying topics from the image labels and examine their relationship with post engagement metrics. This analysis provides insights into content preferences of the audience and strategies to enhance engagement on Instagram.

**Tasks:**

**Task A: Topic Modeling and Engagement Analysis**
1. **Data Collection:** Retrieve Instagram posts along with their associated image labels generated by Google Vision.
2. **Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the image labels, including tokenization and removal of stop words.
3. **Topic Modeling (LDA):** Apply LDA to identify latent topics within the image labels. Determine the optimal number of topics through evaluation metrics such as coherence score and interpretability.
4. **Topic Interpretation:** Examine the top 25 words for each topic and assign suitable names based on semantic similarity.
5. **Engagement Quartile Analysis:** Sort the data based on engagement metrics (# of comments) and divide it into highest and lowest quartiles. Calculate average topic weights for images in each quartile.
6. **Comparison:** Identify differences in topic weights between the highest and lowest engagement quartiles. Summarize main findings in a table.

**Task B: Recommendations for Increasing Engagement**
1. **Insights Interpretation:** Based on the analysis results, provide actionable insights on content strategies for increasing engagement on Instagram.
2. **Recommendations:** Offer tailored recommendations to the client, including suggestions on content themes, visual elements, and posting frequency.
3. **Engagement Optimization:** Advise on engagement optimization techniques such as leveraging high-weight topics, diversifying content, and fostering community interaction.
4. **Iterative Improvement:** Emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring and adjustment based on audience feedback and performance metrics.

**Project Deliverables:**
1. **Code Implementation:** Provide Python scripts for data collection, preprocessing, topic modeling, and engagement analysis.
2. **Documentation:** Detailed explanation of the methodology, including parameter selection, evaluation metrics, and interpretation of results.
3. **Recommendation Report:** Summarize key findings and actionable recommendations for the client to enhance Instagram engagement effectively.

**Conclusion:**
By combining topic modeling with engagement analysis, this project offers valuable insights for optimizing Instagram content strategy. The comprehensive analysis enables data-driven decision-making and fosters continuous improvement in audience engagement and content performance.
